## Installation
    This application is ran out of the command line utilizing the Node.js Inquirer module. Installation is simply handled by cloning the repository from my GitHub account.  I used Visual Studio Code to write this. 

## Usage
    Text Instructions:
    Clone the GitHub repository and install the required dependancies using the code 'npm i' in the command line input.  Use 'node index.js' and answer the questions that pop up.  The console will tell you if it successfully wrote a README for you.  The generated README will be available in the generated_files folder.
